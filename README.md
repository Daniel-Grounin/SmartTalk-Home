# Smart Talking Plant Simulation

This project simulates a talking plant that interacts based on its health data (soil moisture, light level). It uses **YOLOv8** for person detection and **TinyDolphin AI** to generate humorous responses based on the plant's condition. The plant "talks" using **Google TTS** (Text-to-Speech) when a person is detected.

## Features:
- **YOLOv8**: Detects if a person is in front of the plant.
- **TinyDolphin AI**: Generates responses based on plant conditions.
- **Google TTS**: Converts the plant's responses to speech.

## Warning:
The AI may respond in a **weird or unnerving manner**â€”it's not always friendly, so expect some **unexpected** and **scary** replies!

## Requirements:
- Python 3.x
- YOLOv8, gTTS, OpenCV, Ollama
