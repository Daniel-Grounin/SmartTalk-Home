# Smart Talking Plant Simulation 🌱🎙️

The **Smart Talking Plant Simulation** is an interactive project that combines the power of AI, computer vision, and text-to-speech technology to simulate a plant that reacts to its environment and interacts with people. The plant monitors its health using sensors for **soil moisture** and **light level** and responds to human presence with humorous and sometimes eerie dialogues. 

Using cutting-edge technologies like **YOLOv8**, **TinyDolphin AI**, and **Google TTS**, this project brings life to a plant by allowing it to "speak" when it detects a person.

## Key Features 🌟

- **Person Detection with YOLOv8**:  
  Utilizes **YOLOv8** for real-time person detection. The plant recognizes if someone is in front of it and begins its interactive session.

- **TinyDolphin AI for Plant Responses**:  
  **TinyDolphin AI** generates context-aware responses based on the plant's current condition (e.g., dryness, light level). This enables the plant to engage in more natural and dynamic interactions.

- **Google Text-to-Speech (TTS)**:  
  **Google TTS** converts the generated text responses into speech, making the plant "talk" when a person is detected nearby.

- **Humorous and Eerie Replies**:  
  The plant doesn't just talk; it might respond in a **weird**, **unnerving**, or **unexpected** manner. Get ready for some **scary** replies!
